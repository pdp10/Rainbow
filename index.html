<p>Rainbow is an open source software simulator of an abstract operating system. It allows users to simulate several scheduling and assignment policies of computer processes and resources, and visualise results as plots and statistics. It is available in 23 languages. This software is release under the GNU General Public License v2.</p>

<h3>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>The original idea of this software was conceived in 2005 at the University of Padua (Italy) in the course of "Software Engineering", as a supporting tool for the course of <em>Operating Systems</em>. The project's name was SGPEMv1 (2005) (in Italian, <em>Simulatore di Gestione dei Processi in un Elaboratore Multiprogrammato</em>. One year later, the same project was purposed again in order to improve its design, and was called SGPEMv2. The SGPEMv2 (2006) project was a re-engineering of SGPEMv1. It reused the code of the main GUI (by Fabio Gallonetto) with some edits, but the engine was completely re-designed. Rainbow is the natural second version of SGPEMv2, but due to its history, it is the third version. Rainbow (2006-now) is a personal initiative, unrelated with the University of Padua.</p>

<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>The name was changed because SGPEM was an Italian acronym. Rainbow was suggested by the colours of 
running processes in the scheduling function, which is represented in a graphical view of the software.
The initial splash image remembers <em>the storm before the rainbow</em>.</p>
