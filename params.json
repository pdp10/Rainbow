{"name":"Rainbow","tagline":"A simulator of computer processes","body":"\r\n# Rainbow\r\nRainbow is a software simulator for computer processes and resources. This software is release under the GNU General Public License v2.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nThe original idea of this software was conceived in 2005 at the University of Padua (Italy) in the course of \"Software Engineering\", as a supporting tool for the course of *Operating Systems*. The project's name was SGPEMv1 (2005) (in Italian, *Simulatore di Gestione dei Processi in un Elaboratore Multiprogrammato*. One year later, the same project was purposed again in order to improve its design, and was called SGPEMv2. The SGPEMv2 (2006) project was a re-engineering of SGPEMv1. It reused the code of the main GUI (by Fabio Gallonetto) with some edits, but the engine was completely re-designed. Rainbow is the natural second version of SGPEMv2, but due to its history, it is the third version. Rainbow (2006-now) is a personal initiative, unrelated with the University of Padua.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal requirements\r\nSoftware requirements: \r\n- JVM 1.7, \r\n- Infonode GUI libraries 1.6.1 (included, GPL license),\r\n- JGoodies GUI libraries 2.3.1 (included, BSD license),\r\n- NimRod GUI libraries 1.2 (included, LGPL license),\r\n- Swing-layout GUI libraries 1.0.3 (included, LGPL license),\r\n- Javahelp 2.0 (included, GPL license, manually compiled).\r\n\r\nHardware requirements: \r\n- Processor: 800 MHz, \r\n- RAM: 128 MB.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compilation / Execution\r\nTo compile the source code, you need JDK 1.7 and Ant. \r\n\r\nEnter in the Rainbow/ folder. Then\r\nTo compile the source code, type:\r\n``` \r\nant jar \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo execute Rainbow, type:\r\n```\r\n# On GNU/Linux: \r\n./rainbow.sh\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# On Windows:\r\nrainbow.bat\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Developing\r\nIf you wish to develop new features, you can fork the project and then send a pull request. Everyone is welcome, particularly students keen to learn how the core of an operating system works.\r\n\r\n\r\n### About\r\nThe name was changed because SGPEM was an Italian acronym. Rainbow was suggested by the colours of \r\nrunning processes in the scheduling function, which is represented in a graphical view of the software.\r\nThe initial splash image remembers *the storm before the rainbow*.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
