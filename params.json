The project's name was SGPEMv1 (2005) (in Italian, \"Simulatore \r\ndi Gestione dei Processi in un Elaboratore Multiprogrammato\", translated: simulator of \r\nthe management of processes in a multitasking computer). One year later, due to faults \r\nand conceptual inconsistencies the same project was purposed again and was called SGPEMv2. \r\nThe SGPEMv2 (2006) project was a re-engineering of SGPEMv1. It reuses the code of the main GUI \r\n(by Fabio Gallonetto) with some adaptions, but the engine was completely designed and \r\nimplemented again. Rainbow is the natural second version of SGPEMv2, but due to its history, \r\nit is the third version. Rainbow (2006-now) is a personal initiative, outside the University of Padua.\r\n\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nMINIMAL REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nSoftware requirements: JVM 1.6, \r\n                       Infonode GUI libraries 1.6.1 (included, GPL license),\r\n                       JGoodies GUI libraries 2.3.1 (included, BSD license),\r\n\t\t       NimRod GUI libraries 1.2 (included, LGPL license),\r\n\t\t       Swing-layout GUI libraries 1.0.3 (included, LGPL license),\r\n\t\t       Javahelp 2.0 (included, GPL license, manually compiled).\r\n\r\nHardware requirements: Processor: 800 MHz, RAM: 128 MB.\r\n\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nCHANGING\r\n\r\nThe aim of Rainbow is to be an useful, powerful and stable software \r\nfor all people that want to learn, understand and study how a \r\nconceptual operating systems works, in particular from the point of \r\nview of the scheduler of processes. \r\nThe main changes are reported below:\r\n \r\nIced-features\r\n- Fix bug in Ant build.xml to create distribution\r\n- Link MANIFEST.MF to build.xml\r\n- Add junit tests\r\n- Simulation of a multi-core system\r\n- Simulation of Linux / Unix system\r\n- Adding a view for comparing the different Scheduling policies\r\n- Generalise this software for simulating business processes and resources (and not just computer processes and resources)\r\n- other ideas? :)\r\n\r\nTrunk\r\n - Re-packaging of classes using org.rainbow\r\n - Use of Ant instead of Make.\r\n - Use of Git for version control.\r\n\r\n3.2.14\r\n - Moved the source code to github \r\n3.2.12\r\n - Bug correction. Added minimal support for future implementation of multi-core process simulation.\r\n3.2.10\r\n - Modularisation of the GUI. Separated Toolbar, Menubar, and Views from RainbowMainGUI. This improves \r\n readability and code extension.\r\n3.2.8\r\n - Simplified the multilanguage management by integrating the language configuration in 1 place. \r\n3.2.6\r\n - Removed automated advancement and replaced with a multi-step mechanism of advancement\r\n3.2.4 \r\n - Redisign of the Scheduler package in order to enable the development \r\n of alternative Schedulers. This aims to generalise this Simulator to a \r\n scenary outside Operating Systems.\r\nBefore v3.2: \r\n - Support of internationalization;\r\n - New design and implementation of the modules:\r\n   Scheduler, SimulatedProcess, AssignmentPolicy, Resource, DataInput;\r\n - Support of the mechanism ICPP (Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol);\r\n - Modular and easy configuration of the Rainbow system;\r\n - New scheduling policies: \r\n        Multilevel Feedback, Preemptive Multilevel Feedback,\r\n        Multilevel Feedback with Dynamic Quantum,\r\n\tPreemptive Multilevel Feedback with Dynamic quantum.\r\n - New assignment policy :\r\n        Highest Priority First\r\n - Export the configuration in html files;\r\n - Maximum layout;\r\n - English translation of all the source code, Help and About menu;\r\n - GNU license v.2;\r\n - Java 1.6 compatible;\r\n - New icons Nuvola;\r\n - Improvement of the Look 'n' Feel;\r\n - Added themes menu and status bar;\r\n - Makefile generated by mmake;\r\n - XML configuration files.\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nCOMPILATION\r\n\r\nYou need JDK 1.6 (see http://java.sun.com/) and Ant.\r\nEnter in Rainbow/src.\r\n\r\n- GNU/Linux\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can simply type:    ant jar \r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nEXECUTE\r\n\r\nYou must enter inside the Rainbow folder. Then execute:\r\n\r\nUnder GNU/Linux: ./rainbow.sh\r\nUnder Windows  : rainbow.bat\r\n\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nABOUT\r\n\r\nThe name was changed because SGPEM was an Italian acronym.\r\nRainbow was suggested by the colors of running processes \r\nin the scheduling function, which is represented in a graphical \r\nview of the software.\r\nThe initial splash image remembers \"the storm before the rainbow\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
